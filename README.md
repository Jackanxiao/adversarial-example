Crafting Adversarial Examples with PyTorch

`craft.py` - Contains crafting algorithms such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Jacobian-based Saliency Map Approach (JSMA)
## Fast Gradient Sign Method with MNIST Datset
1. `train_mnist.py` - Train a model with the original MNIST
2. `craft_mnist_fgsm.py' - Craft adversarial exmaples by using FGSM
